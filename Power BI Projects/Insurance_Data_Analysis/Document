Insurance Data Analysis and Claim Incident Analysis
Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing insurance data and claim incidents. The dataset used for analysis consists of 1000 individual claims, with the primary goal to present Insurance and incident information. The dataset includes 40 different attributes that describe each claim, categorized into four main categories: the insured person, their policy details, incident description, and characteristics of the involved car.

Project Goals
The main objectives of this Power BI project are as follows:

Analyze the frequency and distribution of fraudulent claims in the dataset.
Identify patterns or factors that may indicate a higher likelihood of fraud in insurance claims.
Explore the relationship between different attributes and the likelihood of fraud.
Visualize the characteristics of insured persons, policy details, and incident descriptions.
Provide insights into claim amounts and the distribution of claims across different categories.
Identify trends or patterns in the time and location of incidents.
Data Analysis and Visualization
Using the Power BI tool, this project offers a variety of interactive visualizations and dashboards. Some of the visualizations and analyses that can be included are:

Bar charts to display the distribution of occupation and education level by number of claims and its claim amount.
Pie charts to display the distribution of number of claims and its amount.
Line charts to explore the relationship between Age and the number of claims.
Time series charts to analyze the frequency and trends of incidents over time.
Gauges to present claim amounts and the distribution of claims by various categories.
Conclusion
The Insurance Data Analysis and Claim Incident Analysis Power BI project provide valuable insights into insurance claim data, with a focus on fraud detection and understanding claim characteristics. By analyzing different attributes and visualizing patterns, this project aims to assist insurance professionals in identifying potential fraudulent claims and improving their overall claim management processes.
